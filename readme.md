# Steamboat

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/steamboat/badge/?version=latest)](https://steamboat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Steamboat is a computational model to decipher short- and long-distance cellular interactions based on the multi-head attention mechanism.

## Standard workflow
```python
import steamboat as sf # "sf" = "Steamboat Factorization"
import steamboat.tools
```

First, make a list (`adatas`) of one or more `AnnData` objects, and preprocess them.
```python
adatas = sf.prep_adatas(adatas, log_norm=True)
dataset = sf.make_dataset(adatas)
```

Create a `Steamboat` model and fit it to the data.
```python
model = sf.Steamboat(adata.var_names.tolist(), d_ego=0, d_local=5, d_global=0)
model = model.to("cuda") # if you GPU acceleration is supported.
model.fit(dataset, masking_rate=0.25)
```

After training you can check the trained metagenes.
```python
sf.tools.plot_transforms(model, figsize=(4, 4), vmin=0.0, vmax=.5, top=0)
```
This can be very slow for a lot of metagenes, so you can use another function to just plot one of them.
```python
plot_transform(model, "local", 0, top=18)
```

For clustering and segmentation, run the following lines. Change the resolution to your liking.
```python
sf.tools.neighbors(adata)
sf.tools.leiden(adata, resolution=0.1)
sf.tools.segment(adata, resolution=0.5)
```
